# Middlebury College Minecraft Map
Weekly automated backup of the Middlebury map folders, for all to download and check out!
You can always explore the map on the official MiddCraft server as well (IP: play.middcraft.com).  Find out more on the [middcraft.com](https://middcraft.com) website.

## Download the map files
First, download the map files. You can do so by clicking the green "Code" or "Clone or download" button on the rop right.  You can download the ZIP file for simplicity, or clone the repository if you're familiar with GitHub.  The zip download will take a few minutes to download, depending on your internet speed.

It will take a few minutes for the ZIP file to download. Once it is downloaded, [unzip](https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File) it.  This will create a folder titled `map-master`, containing all of the Minecraft map folders & files.

Try following [this guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Download-a-GitHub-Folder) on how to download a GitHub folder if the above instructions were unclear to you.

## Setup the map locally
Next, find the Minecraft game folder that was created on your computer when you first launched Minecraft.
- Windows users: it will be located under your [AppData folder](https://www.howtogeek.com/318177/what-is-the-appdata-folder-in-windows/). It may be titled `.minecraft`.
- Mac & Linux users: you'll find it under `~/Library/Application Support/` (access the folder by opening a Finder window, hitting `shift` + `command` + `G` and typing in that path). You should find the `minecraft` folder in there.

Open the Minecraft folder.  You will see a folder titled `Saves` -- this is where all of your Minecraft maps are located.  In a separate window, go into your `map-master` folder.  Drag and drop the `world` folder in `map-master` into your Minecraft's 'Saves' folder.  Rename the 'world' folder to something more familiar, such as `MiddCraft` or `Middlebury`.

That's it! Launch Minecraft under the game's latest version, hit `Singleplayer` and join the `MiddCraft`/`Middlebury` world (it will still be titled `world` if you have not changed the title).

If these instructions were unhelpful to you, try following this [WikiHow guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-a-Custom-Minecraft-Map) on how to get the map set up on your local computer.

### Note

You can disregard the `world_nether` and `world_end` folders, however they are included in the event that one wishes to explore them too (though the Minecraft Middlebury map is strictly located in the `world` folder).
